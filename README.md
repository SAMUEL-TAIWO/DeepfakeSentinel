# Audio Deepfake Detection Project  

Welcome to my **Audio Deepfake Detection** project!

This project involves the development of a model that classifies audio as either **real** or **fake**. The goal is to detect deepfake audio, which could be used for malicious purposes such as generating fake voices or misleading audio content.  

In this project, I combine **sentiment analysis** techniques to analyze emotions in the audio, using that information to classify whether the audio is spam (fake) or not. The model will then be fed into a **cybersecurity system** designed to determine the authenticity of the audio.

## Key Features  

- **Audio Processing**:  
  - Raw audio files are preprocessed and converted into features like **MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)** for analysis.  
  - Advanced signal processing methods are applied to clean and structure the data.  

- **Sentiment Analysis**:  
  - Using **NLP techniques**, emotions expressed in the audio are analyzed.  
  - This layer helps in identifying misleading or manipulative content in the audio.  

- **Model Development**:  
  - Machine learning and deep learning algorithms are implemented to classify audio as **real** or **fake**.  
  - The focus is on creating a robust, high-accuracy detection model.  

- **Cybersecurity Integration**:  
  - The trained model is integrated into a **cybersecurity framework** to evaluate and flag potentially malicious audio content.

## Why This is Fun and Interesting 

Working with audio data, especially for detecting deepfakes, is both challenging and fascinating! The complexity of sound processing, feature extraction, and building robust models makes this a great learning experience. Exploring how **AI** can address real-world issues like **cybersecurity** and **misinformation** keeps the project engaging and impactful. üòä
